                <p class="unspaced-top">Written by SHE WHO MARINATES YOUR GALAXY FOR AN EVEN MORE DELICIOUS AND PAINFUL DINNER</p>

                <p>Who is the best brawler in the MILKY WAY galaxy? That is a question many have been anticipating to be asked again for a century. Now the time has come around again to award a single sapient with the awayd of BEST BAR FIGHTER once again, and all the fame that comes with such an achievement.</p>
                
                <p class="unspaced-bottom">The requirements for eligiability in the poll are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="unspaced-top">
                    <li>Non-Citizen of GOR-GON'GILLA</li>
                    <li>Citizen of a nation with territory in the MILKY WAY</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="unspaced-bottom">As is the nature of any subjective poll, the criteria are who you think is the most interesting brawler. Whether that be pure skill or flashiness, it is your choice to make. Whatever choice you make, make sure it's who you'd want to fight most. With that said, below are the top candidates for the BEST BAR FIGHTER award:</p>
                <ul class="unspaced-top">
                    <li>LOTAK RIPLEY: He's a name that's not been heard of in a while, but he's still one of the nastiest supersoldiers around. His achievements may not be as widely-known as any of the others, but you should not discount the BLACK UNIVERSE and its horrors.</li>
                    <li>PHILLIP H. MALLARD: An unexpected contender who has earned candidacy not for raw skill or power, but sheer tenacity. An underdog by all means, but with perhaps more heart than any other foolish weakling around.</li>
                    <li>SEQUO FEIRU: Without a doubt the single most skilled fighter in the whole galaxy. He can obliterate you personally or strategically, and he hasn't consistently lost any military game in the hundreds of thousands of years he's been alive.</li>
                    <li>TRELIO EKAFE: The premier supersoldier of the weakling nation DHATRI TSARDOM. They might be a bunch of pansies who play both monarchy AND pretend democracy, but TRELIO's skill can't be denied. He's perhaps the only one on this list who has fought something as powerful as a GOR-GON'GILLA and won.</li>
                </ul>
